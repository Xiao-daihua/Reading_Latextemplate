  abstract = {We propose a precise reformulation of 3d quantum gravity with negative cosmological constant in terms of a topological quantum field theory based on the quantization of the Teichm\textbackslash "uller space of Riemann surfaces that we refer to as ``Virasoro TQFT.'' This TQFT is similar, but importantly not equivalent, to \$\textbackslash text\{SL\}(2,\textbackslash mathbb\{R\})\$ Chern-Simons theory. This sharpens the folklore that 3d gravity is related to \$\textbackslash text\{SL\}(2,\textbackslash mathbb\{R\})\$ Chern-Simons theory into a precise correspondence, and resolves some well-known issues with this lore at the quantum level. Our proposal is computationally very useful and provides a powerful tool for the further study of 3d gravity. In particular, we explain how together with standard TQFT surgery techniques this leads to a fully algorithmic procedure for the computation of the gravity partition function on a fixed topology exactly in the central charge. Mathematically, the relation leads to many nontrivial conjectures for hyperbolic 3-manifolds, Virasoro conformal blocks and crossing kernels.},
